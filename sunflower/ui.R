                 During the night, the flowers may assume a random orientation, 
                 while at dawn they turn again toward the east where the sun rises. 
                 The motion is performed by motor cells in a flexible segment just below the flower, 
                 called a pulvinus. The motor cells are specialized in pumping potassium ions 
                 into nearby tissues, changing their turgor pressure. 
                 The segment flexes because the motor cells at the shadow side elongate due to
                 a turgor rise. Heliotropism is a response to light from the sun.
